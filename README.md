# Metal in C++

**Without XCode** - This repo uses CMake and VSCode to make Metal functions accessible in C++.

It's not very clean, main.cpp just builds everything without any consideration for hiding behind abstraction or reusability. This repo isn't supposed to provide a complete solution, just a template to build further off of.

This repo is heavily derived from https://github.com/LeeTeng2001/metal-cpp-cmake, except that all of the examples have been stripped out, and I tried to make the compute pipeline as simple as possible.

I have no use for rendering or presenting windows so none of that code is here.
